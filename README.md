# My Portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio website built using **React** and **Vite**. It serves as an online showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences, designed to make an impactful impression on potential recruiters and collaborators.

## Features

- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Smooth navigation between sections without page reloads.
- **Custom Design**: A unique aesthetic inspired by the [Obsidian website](https://obsidian.md/), with a dark theme and vibrant accent colors.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Optimized Performance**: Leveraging Vite for fast builds and HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
- **SCSS Styling**: Organized and maintainable styling using SCSS and BEM methodology.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: For a fast and modern build tool.
- **SCSS**: For modular and maintainable CSS.
- **BEM**: For consistent and clear class naming.
